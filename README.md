## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default configuration includes [xAI](https://x.ai) models (`grok-2-vision-1212`, `grok-3-mini`) routed through the gateway.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
